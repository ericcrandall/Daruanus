#I modified the genepop file by adding sampling coordinates as the name of the 
#last individual in each population. There is no coastline for these samples,
# which each come from different islands. I just measured from Tahiti to Maupiti
# It's 65 km from the tip of Tahiti Iti to Puna, so I added that to 
# each coordinate.
