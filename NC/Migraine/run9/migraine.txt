# I modified the genepop file by adding sampling coordinates as the name of the 
# last individual in each population. These coordinates were distances in km along 
# a the mostly linear SW coastline of New Caledonia, 
# which runs a total of ~612km. It is ~418km to the first population at Mara, 
# so I am adding that value to the coordinates in the file.
