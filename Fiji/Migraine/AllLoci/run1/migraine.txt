#I modified the genepop file by adding sampling coordinates as the name of the 
#last individual in each population. These coordinates were distances in km 
#along the Viti Levu reef and coastline from Ovalu in the east to the Yasawas 
#in the northwest: a total of ~414km. I measured all distances in Google Earth

#Neighborhood size is based on mean distance between populations = 46.66
#414/46.66 = 8.87 so I will use 10 bins
